# Weather App 🌅

#### What is it? 

In this project, I built a simple, single page dynamic weather app utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API to display current weather from any location.

Additionally, using the sunset and sunrise data returned from the API call I was able to create a dynamic backdrop that went dark depending on whether it was currently night or not in a given area.
